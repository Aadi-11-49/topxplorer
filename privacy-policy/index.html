  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>At TopXplorer, protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. We understand that when you use our financial calculators and tools, you trust us with sensitive information, and we are committed to handling it responsibly. Our platform is designed with privacy in mind, and we take every measure to ensure that your personal information is never collected, stored, or shared without your consent. All calculations performed on TopXplorer happen locally in your browser, which means that the data you input stays on your device and is never transmitted to our servers. This approach allows you to use our services safely and securely, without any concern about unauthorized access to your personal information.</p>
  <br>
  <p>While we do not store personal data, we may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance the performance and functionality of our website. These cookies help us improve the user experience, such as by remembering preferences or optimizing page load times, but they do not track personally identifiable information. Any data collected through cookies is used strictly for site improvement purposes and is never linked to your personal identity.</p>
  <br>
  <p>TopXplorer may also display advertisements through third-party networks, such as Google AdSense, to support the ongoing development and maintenance of our free services. These third-party providers may collect certain information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We encourage users to review these policies to understand how third-party services handle data, as TopXplorer does not control the data collection practices of external advertisers.</p>
  <br>
  <p>We are committed to transparency and providing users with clear information about how their privacy is protected. If you have any questions, concerns, or need further clarification regarding our privacy practices, you are encouraged to contact us directly. Our team is always ready to address your queries and ensure that you feel safe and informed while using TopXplorer.
