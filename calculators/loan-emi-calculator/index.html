    <h2>How Loan EMI is Calculated</h2>
    <p>
      EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is calculated based on loan amount,
      interest rate, and tenure using a standard financial formula.
    </p>
     <h2>What is a Loan EMI?</h2>
  <p>
    EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed amount that a borrower pays to a lender every month
    to repay a loan. An EMI consists of two parts: the principal loan amount and the interest charged on it.
    The EMI amount remains constant throughout the loan tenure, while the proportion of interest and principal
    changes over time.
  </p>

  <h2>How Does the Loan EMI Calculator Work?</h2>
  <p>
    The Loan EMI Calculator helps you calculate your monthly EMI based on three inputs: loan amount, interest rate,
    and loan tenure. Once you enter these values, the calculator uses a standard financial formula to instantly
    compute your monthly EMI, total interest payable, and total amount payable over the loan period.
  </p>
  <p>
    This calculator also provides a visual pie chart that clearly shows the breakup between the principal amount
    and the total interest payable, making it easier to understand the overall cost of your loan.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Use an EMI Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    Using an EMI calculator before taking a loan helps you plan your finances better. It allows you to compare
    different loan options, adjust the loan tenure, and understand how interest rates affect your monthly payments.
    This helps in choosing a loan that fits comfortably within your budget without financial stress.
